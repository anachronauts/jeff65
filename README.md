*jeff65* is a compiler for the Commodore 64 (and perhaps in the future, other
6502-based computers). It is implemented in Python 3 and produces .prg files
which can be loaded directly in VICE, or combined into .d64 disk images, written
to a floppy disk, and run on real hardware.

**note:** this project is currently in its early stages. Features discussed below
are largely the product of wishful thinking and may change at any time.

*jeff65* compiles languages using *gold* syntax, producing *blum* files as
intermediate files. *gold* syntax provides an imperative systems language for
6502-series processors.

Invocation:

    usage: jeff65 [-h] input_file

    positional arguments:
      input_file  the file to compile

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit


## Licensing

The *jeff65* compiler itself is provided under the GPLv3 license; if you
distribute a modified version of the compiler, you must also make the source
code for your modified version available, as described in the license terms. A
copy of the GPLv3 license is included in `LICENSE.txt` in the source
distribution.

The standard library units and runtime library, whenever they get written, will
probably be provided either using the GPL with a linking exception, or under a
non-copyleft license.


## Gold-syntax

Gold-syntax provides an imperative systems programming language for 6502-series
processors. Features of the processor are exposed in a friendly-but-powerful
way; it should be possible to understand what code will be generated by looking
directly at the source file.

Gold-syntax is not associated with the Gold parser framework or the gold LLVM
linker.

Here is an example file which puts a light red heart to the top-left corner of
the screen, which actually works with the compiler in its current, very
unfinished, state:

```
use mem

constant screen-corner: &u8 = mem.as-pointer(0x0400)
constant screen-corner-color: &u8 = mem.as-pointer(0xd800)

fun main()
  @screen-corner = 0x53      /* screencode for <3 */
  @screen-corner-color = 10  /* light red */
endfun
```
